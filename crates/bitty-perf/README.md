# `bitty-perf`

> Independent validation suite (relocated out of the `bitty` workspace by
> W-105, bitty CTX-0931). Canonical product and architecture
> documentation lives in `bitty-terminal-docs` and shared governance in
> `bitty-docs`; this file is a crate-local map, not a canonical contract.

## Purpose

`bitty-perf` owns the performance baseline harness: it hosts the
workspace-root `benches/` targets so `cargo bench` compiles while the
workspace stays virtual, and it carries probe instrumentation covering the
`bitty-terminal` cold path plus input latency and idle behavior. Everything is
headless, bounded, and `forbid(unsafe_code)`; budget definitions live in the
referenced performance RFC and evidence notes, not here (see `src/lib.rs`).
Production crates are consumed at a pinned immutable `bitty` revision (see
`Cargo.toml`); this crate is never a product-workspace member and is never
linked into a product artifact.

## Boundaries

- Pinned-revision production dependencies, per `Cargo.toml`: `bitty-vt`,
  `bitty-term-state`, `bitty-render`, `bitty-platform`, `bitty-pty`,
  `bitty-runtime`, `bitty-config`, and `bitty-ui`.
- Third-party dependencies, per `Cargo.toml`: `pollster` and `winit`, the
  latter only for bounded real-window probes; no network-facing dependency is
  declared.
- Bench targets live at `benches/*.rs` in the repository root, not in this
  crate directory.
- Display-tied phases report `Unavailable` with their attempt duration on
  headless CI rather than requiring a display (see `src/startup.rs`).

## Layout

- `Cargo.toml` — package metadata, dependencies, and bench target wiring.
- `src/lib.rs` — crate docs, budget pointers, and the headless witness.
- `src/startup.rs` — cold-path phase instrumentation.
- `src/latency.rs` — input-latency stage breakdown.
- `src/idle.rs` — frame-on-demand idle gating.
- `src/parser_throughput.rs` — parser-throughput baseline measurement and
  ratio gate (CTX-0576, M1-11); corpora loading, median-of-rounds
  measurement, baseline parsing, and the regression check.
- `src/real_window.rs` — real-window PB-1 startup (launch-to-first-frame
  p50/p99) and PB-2 idle-RSS measurement (CTX-0592); opt-in, bounded,
  `Unavailable` without `BITTY_PERF_REAL_WINDOW=1`.
- `src/real_soak.rs` — long-duration real-render soak automation (CTX-0642,
  PERF-09): clamped soak config, bounded capture plan, `hyprctl` + `grim`
  leg probing, RSS trend helpers, and schedule/evidence JSON builders;
  opt-in, bounded, `Unavailable` without `BITTY_PERF_REAL_SOAK=1`.
- `src/dogfood_session.rs` — continuous daily-driver session automation
  (CTX-0643, PERF-10): clamped session config, bounded cycle plan over the
  six app surfaces (shell, cargo, git, nvim, tmux, ssh), per-cycle
  evidence rows, and schedule/evidence JSON builders; opt-in, bounded,
  `Unavailable` without `BITTY_PERF_DOGFOOD_SESSION=1`. The pixel leg and
  RSS helpers are shared with the soak chain.
- `baselines/parser-throughput.json` — committed baseline artifact (numbers
  plus provenance); `baselines/README.md` records the runbook, exact command,
  environment, and limitations.
- `baselines/pb-real-window.json` — committed real-window evidence artifact
  (PB-1/PB-2 numbers plus host context and provenance);
  `baselines/real-window-evidence.md` records the runbook and limitations.
- `baselines/pb-rss.json` — committed PB-2 idle-RSS artifact for #1190
  (CTX-0694 re-measurement plus host context and provenance);
  `baselines/rss-evidence.md` records the contributor breakdown and the
  reduction path proposal.
- `baselines/pb-real-soak.json` — committed long-duration soak artifact
  (PB-3/PB-7 numbers plus host context and provenance, `unavailable` until
  the first Tier 1 run is promoted);
  `baselines/real-soak-evidence.md` records the automation runbook,
  scheduling, and limitations.
- `baselines/pb-dogfood-session.json` — committed daily-driver session
  artifact (PB-3/PB-7 numbers plus host context and provenance,
  `unavailable` until the first Tier 1 session is promoted);
  `baselines/dogfood-session-evidence.md` records the automation runbook,
  scheduling, and limitations.
- `tests/parser_throughput_regression.rs` — bounded CI regression gate run by
  plain `cargo test` (also on the optimized `bench` profile via
  `just perf-parser`).
- `tests/real_window_evidence.rs` — bounded CI contract test for the
  real-window harness (asserts `Unavailable` without opt-in and baseline
  provenance).
- `tests/real_soak_evidence.rs` — bounded CI contract test for the soak
  planner (asserts gate/leg discipline, plan math, and artifact
  provenance); the script chain is covered headlessly by
  `scripts/tests/real-render-soak.test.sh` (`just real-render-soak-test`).
- `tests/dogfood_session_evidence.rs` — bounded CI contract test for the
  session planner (asserts gate/leg discipline, cycle plan math, app
  selection validation, and artifact provenance); the script chain is
  covered headlessly by `scripts/tests/dogfood-session.test.sh`
  (`just dogfood-session-test`).

## Parser throughput baseline (CTX-0576, M1-11)

`src/parser_throughput.rs` measures `bitty_vt::Parser::advance` in isolation
over reused deterministic corpora (`bitty-vt` seeds, `tests/compat/*/corpus`,
a synthetic escape storm) and compares the escape/plain throughput ratios
against `baselines/parser-throughput.json`. The gate is generous
(4× ratio collapse) so shared runners and debug `cargo test` builds do not
flake; it catches pathological regressions only. Run `just perf-parser` for
the optimized verdict and `just perf-parser-baseline` to regenerate the
artifact after a recorded environment change.

## Real-window PB-1/PB-2 evidence (CTX-0592)

`src/real_window.rs` launches the real `bitty` binary and measures the accepted
budgets end-to-end: PB-1 cold startup (process launch to the first presented
frame, p50/p99) and PB-2 idle RSS (one window, bounded idle interval). It is
opt-in — `BITTY_PERF_REAL_WINDOW=1` plus a built binary — and reports
`Unavailable` with a reason otherwise, so headless CI never fabricates numbers.
Run `just perf-real-window` on a Tier 1 host and `just
perf-real-window-baseline` to regenerate the artifact; see
`baselines/real-window-evidence.md` for the runbook and limitations.

## Long-duration real-render soak (CTX-0642, PERF-09)

`src/real_soak.rs` plus `scripts/real-render-soak.sh` automate the
previously manual `hyprctl` + `grim` capture leg as a schedulable soak: a
real window runs for hours while each capture pairs a `grim` screenshot
with a DevTools-preferred `bitty ctl terminal text` snapshot and an RSS
sample for the PB-3 anchor. Planning (`just perf-real-soak`,
`--dry-run`) is headless-safe; live runs need `BITTY_PERF_REAL_SOAK=1`
and a Hyprland session, otherwise they report `Unavailable` and exit 2.
See `baselines/real-soak-evidence.md` for the runbook, scheduling, and
the committed `baselines/pb-real-soak.json` shape.

## Continuous daily-driver dogfood session (CTX-0643, PERF-10)

`src/dogfood_session.rs` plus `scripts/dogfood-session.sh` build on the
soak chain: instead of one synthetic workload, each cycle drives every
selected daily-driver app once through `bitty ctl terminal send` (shell,
cargo, git, nvim, tmux, ssh — a subset is selectable via
`BITTY_PERF_SESSION_APPS`), then records the same per-cycle triple the
soak uses (pixel capture, grid-text snapshot, RSS sample). Planning
(`just perf-dogfood-session`, `--dry-run`) is headless-safe; live runs
need `BITTY_PERF_DOGFOOD_SESSION=1` and a Hyprland session, otherwise
they report `Unavailable` and exit 2. The headless continuity proof —
all six surfaces rotating through one runtime with per-cycle bounds and
deterministic replay — is
`cargo test -p bitty-runtime --test dogfooding
dogfood_daily_driver_session_continuous_bounded`
(also wired into `scripts/dogfood.sh`). See
`baselines/dogfood-session-evidence.md` for the runbook, scheduling, and
the committed `baselines/pb-dogfood-session.json` shape.
