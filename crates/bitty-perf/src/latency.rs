//! Input latency path measurement — PB-4 key-to-screen ≤8 ms p50 / ≤15 ms p99.
//!
//! Covers the full `keydown → PTY → parser → state → render → present`
//! pipeline per task scope, with bounded tracing (≤64 B per key, ≤8 KiB per
//! batch, ≤256 damage regions). Each sample timestamps the hot-path stages
//! via `Instant`; statistics are p50/p99/mean/max, not single-point.
//!
//! The tracer never touches Lua, plugins, or the cold queue beyond pushing
//! bounded observations — proving the plugin pipeline stays off the hot path
//! (core-boundaries.md). On headless CI the present seam is
//! `Surface::headless_present` (deterministic, no display server); on a real
//! Wayland box the same tracer can be driven with a frame-presented timestamp
//! (future slice) without changing this API.
